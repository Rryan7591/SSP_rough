Geographic and Subspecies Variation in the Song Structure of the Seaside Sparrow, Ammospiza maritima

Abstract:
Geographic variation in song is common in temperate passerines, but previous studies exploring song variation in Seaside Sparrows have not examined song at a range-wide scale. We analyzed the song structure of nine subspecies of Seaside Sparrow to describe how song varies geographically and ask whether variation in song structure aligns with subspecies designations. We gathered songs from the collections of the Macaulay Library, Borror Institute of Sound, Florida Natural History Museum, and Xeno-Canto, and also recorded songs at several sites in Texas. The song of the Seaside Sparrow has a distinctive two-part structure consisting of an introduction, composed of a warble containing a variety of syllables, followed by a terminal buzz. Descriptive measures of song such as duration, minimum, and maximum frequency were recorded for the introduction and the terminal buzz. We also recorded the total number of syllables in the introduction, and the pulse period for the terminal buzz. Finally, each syllable from every song was categorized into one of six syllable types, then grouped by specific identity within each type. Using ANOVAs and PCA we explored if songs clustered geographically based on elements of song structure, syllable composition, or syllable identity. The variation observed did not partition by subspecies designation, but some features of the song do vary geographically.
